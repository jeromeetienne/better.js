# The Good

--

### Create Virtuous cycle

* documenting doc is good
* testing is good
* the more documented is your code, the more tested is safer it become

--

### Expand test coverage

* jsdoc provide plenty of useful information
* it was rarely/never use to test code
* it detects a new type of error.

--

### During Execution

* js is really dynamic
* it has to be tested during execution

--

### Plain old javascript

* all code is actually valid javascript
* no new language to learn

--

# The Bad

--

### Slow down execution

* All those checking costs time
* not that important during the test phase tho
  * don't use it in production

It is like a [debug build](http://vinayakgarg.wordpress.com/2012/03/31/difference-between-debug-build-and-release-build/)
